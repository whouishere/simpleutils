# simpleutils
simpleutils is as an alternative (though not a replacement) coreutils package.

Note that simpleutils is not supposed to be a full and 100% faithful replacement for GNU coreutils nor it is meant to be POSIX complient.
I just wanted to create this for sheer fun and to challenge myself.

Though I do want to make the code as simple as possible, always __trying__ to follow the Unix philosophy and the KISS principle, note that I am not perfect nor an experienced programmer.
If you notice something can be better, especially more simple, please contribute to the code!
