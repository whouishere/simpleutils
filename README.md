# simpleutils
simpleutils is as an alternative (though not a replacement) coreutils package.

Note that simpleutils is not supposed to be a full and 100% faithful replacement for GNU coreutils nor it is meant to be POSIX complient.
I just wanted to create this for sheer fun and to challenge myself.

Though I do want to make the code as simple as possible, always __trying__ to follow the Unix philosophy and the KISS principle, note that I am not perfect nor an experienced programmer.
If you notice something can be better, especially more simple, please contribute to the code!

## Running
If you really want to test some of the utilities out, you may install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) first in order to use the build system.

With that out of the way, it is possible to build every utility using the `task build`.

If you just want to test out some utility though, you can use the `task run UTIL=<utility> -- <args>` command. Substitute `<utility>` with an utility, `cat` as an example, and `<args>` with the desired command line arguments, like `--help`.

## Progress
